🩺 Accessible AI Healthcare
Automated TB and Eye Disease Diagnosis Using Medical Imaging
📌 Overview

Accessible AI Healthcare is an AI-powered medical imaging diagnostic system designed to assist in the early detection of Tuberculosis (TB) and eye diseases using deep learning. The system analyzes chest X-ray images for TB detection and eye/fundus images for identifying conditions such as cataract and diabetic retinopathy.
The project aims to improve healthcare accessibility, especially in rural and resource-limited areas, by providing fast and reliable AI-based diagnostic support.

🎯 Problem Statement

Early diagnosis of TB and eye diseases is critical but often delayed due to:

Shortage of medical specialists

Limited diagnostic facilities in rural regions

High cost and time required for manual analysis

This project addresses these challenges by leveraging Artificial Intelligence to automate disease detection from medical images.

💡 Solution

The proposed system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze medical images and classify them as diseased or normal.
Users can upload medical images through a simple interface, and the system provides predictions that assist healthcare professionals in making faster decisions.
